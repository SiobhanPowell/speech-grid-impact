In this paper we study the generation-level grid impacts of deep electric vehicle adoption in WECC, the Western US, comparing the effects of charging infrastructure access and conventional charging control.

### Contents

The code is divided into two folders, one containing all the electric vehicle (EV) charging model and one containing the grid model. The EV charging model was run first to generate a range of charging demand scenarios. Then, the grid model was used to quantify the grid impacts for each case. 

Each subfolder has an extended `README.md` describing its contents and use.

### Data

We have posted the model objects and charging profiles publicly to accompany the paper. This repository contains instructions and sample code to show how you could use them to run other scenarios. Please contact the authors with any questions.
